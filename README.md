> **Size:** 539.29 kB

This JSON file contains basic identification information about publicly traded companies filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Each entry consists of:
- CIK (Central Index Key): Unique identifier assigned by the SEC.
- Name: The companyâ€™s official name.
- Ticker: The symbol under which the company trades.

The JSON object has two primary keys:
- fields: an array of field names in order, e.g. ["cik", "name", "ticker", "exchange"].
- data: an array of company records, each structured like [789019, "MICROSOFT CORP", "MSFT", "Nasdaq"].
